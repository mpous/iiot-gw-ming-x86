  ## Usage instructions

  Run this Industrial IoT Gateway gateway compatible with `amd64` and `x86` using NodeRED, MQTT, InfluxDB and Grafan to convert legacy to digital in the edge.
  
  To access NodeRED use the local IP address on port 80, if you are on the same network of your device. You also can use the `Publick Device URL` by balena to access to the Node-RED UI.

  Use `balena` as Username and Password to access to the Node-RED UI. You can change this variables on the `Device Variables`.

  To access Grafana use the local IP address on port 3000.
