# Industrial IoT Gateway with Node-RED and MQTT broker running on balena

This is a project based on the [balena Node-RED block](https://github.com/balenablocks/balena-node-red) which supports the Node-RED [balena flow](https://github.com/balena-io-projects/node-red-contrib-balena). It can be managed remotely via balena [publicURL](https://balena.io/docs/learn/manage/actions/#enable-public-device-url).

## Requirements

### Hardware

* Intel Nuc (`amd64`) and Generic x86 devices (still WIP for Raspberry Pi and similar)
* USB drive
* Power supply and (optionally) ethernet cable

### Software

* A balenaCloud account ([sign up here](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/))
* [balenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher)


## Deploy

You have two options here:

### One-click deploy via [Balena Deploy](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/deploy/deploy-with-balena-button/)

You can deploy this project to a new balenaCloud application in one click using the button below:

[![](https://balena.io/deploy.svg)](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/deploy?repoUrl=https://github.com/mpous/nodeRED-iiot-gateway)

Or, you can create an application in your balenaCloud dashboard and balena push this code to it the traditional way.

### In-control deploy via [balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/balena-cli/)

If you are a balena CLI expert, feel free to use balena CLI. This option lets you configure in detail some options, like adding new services to your deploy or configure de DNS Server to use.

- Sign up on [balena.io](https://dashboard.balena.io/signup)
- Create a new fleet on balenaCloud.
- Add a new device and download the image of the BalenaOS it creates.
- Burn the USB drive, connect it to the x86 device and boot it up (you might go to the BIOS to make the device to boot from the USB on the first time. Please read more here).

While the device boots (it will eventually show up in the Balena dashboard) we will prepare de services:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/mpous/nodeRED-iiot-gateway
cd nodeRED-iiot-gateway
```

- Using [Balena CLI](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/cli/), push the code with `balena push <fleet-name>`
- See the magic happening, your device is getting updated ðŸŒŸOver-The-AirðŸŒŸ!


## Variables

### Device Variables

Variable Name | Default | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
PORT | `80` | the port that exposes the Node-RED UI
USERNAME | `balena` | the Node-RED admin username
PASSWORD | `balena` | the Node-RED admin password
ENCRIPTION_KEY | `balena` | the encription key used to store your credentials files

You **must** set the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` environment variables to be able to save or run programs in Node-RED.  



## Node-RED

For running Node-RED, use the local IP address on port 80, if you are on the same network than your device. You also can use the `Publick Device URL` by balena to access to the Node-RED UI.
Introduce the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` specified as a Variable on balenaCloud. The default are `balena`.

### Add Node-RED nodes needed

Add the `node-red-contrib-modbus` nodes on your Node-RED. Open the top-right menu, click `Manage palette`. Go to the `Install` tab and search *node-red-contrib-modbus*. Click Install.
Also add the `influxdb` nodes following the same process. Search *node-red-contrib-influxdb*  and install it.

New blocks of nodes should appear on your left menu now called `Storage` and `Modbus`.

### Use the MQTT broker

The MQTT broker is located on your localhost port 1883 or on the `mqtt` service running on the device.

### Start building your flows

Now you can start building your flows and deploy them to your gateway. You can find an example of the flows we built for a workshop [here](https://github.com/oriolrius/miot-nodered-demo).
